[TOC]

# Overview

This document describes the functionality, datastructures, validation rules of the **FAT-1** token standard: A non-fungible data only token standard built on Factom chains and entries. It's functionality is most alike the ERC-721 token standard of Ethereum.





# Motivation

Extend upon the FAT-0 standard by offering non-fungible token functionality for unique, indivisible, and traceable assets.

Applications include tokenized equity, commodities, financial instruments, and digital goods.





# Specification



## Token ID  `extends` [FATIP-100](100.md)



## Addresses `extends` [FATIP-0](0.md)



## Token Issuance Chain 

Unlike FAT-0, the issuance chain can contain multiple entries. FAT-1 allows the ongoing issuance of unique tokens over time up to a maximum supply. 

 

### Issuance Chain ID Derivation  `extends` [FATIP-100](100.md)



### Token Issuance Entry `extends` [FATIP-101](101.md)

FAT-1 token issuance entries include a additional `tokens` field, which is an array of unique token objects, each signed by the issuing identity .

 Every token in the issuance must be valid for the issuance entry to be valid. Issuing a token does not place the token into the circulating supply. Once issued the token can be sent via coinbase transaction by ID to it's initial bearer.



#### Individual FAT-1 Tokens `extends` [FATIP-101](101.md)

Each token in the `tokens` field must contain a unique ID with respect to this FAT-1 token. I.e having two `greple` tokens with the ID `0` is illegal. However, having a `greple` token with ID `0` and a `testfat0token` with ID `0` is legal. It's best to choose short IDs since doing so maximizes the amount of tokens that can be issued in a single issuance. As with any Factom entry, it's maximum size can be 10KB in content.

## Token Transaction Chain

Inherits directly from the [FATIP-0](/) standard.



### Transaction Chain ID `extends` [FATIP-100](100.md)

Identifier: `<tokenid>:transactions`



### Token Transaction Entry `extends`* [FATIP-101](101.md)

Transaction entries of FAT-1 tokens contain a `tokenIds` field, which is an array of the tokenIds being sent in the transaction. Since the `[input|output].amount` field is not relevant in the same way as FAT-0, it is used as a means to secure the `tokenIds` field via djb2a hashing. With an overwhelming probability this results in a transaction that has an unfeasibly large integer `amount` to transfer on Factom for replaying a Factoid transaction. This is in addition to the `nonce` which is a random integer used as the timestamp in the signed Factoid transaction.

**\* = required for coinbase transaction**



#### Contextual Tansaction Validation

FAT-1 Tansactions must be validated in context of their order within the transaction history to applied to an address's balance, just as in FAT-0. Alternate and additional validation criteria is required to support non-fungible functionality:



- Must meet and pass all applicable validation criteria specified in the above field table
- `signature` may not be reused for any transaction
- **IF**: The transaction is a coinbase transaction (From `FA1y5ZGuHSLmf2TqNf6hVMkPiNGyQpQDTFJvDLRkKQaoPo4bmbgu`):
  - `idSignature` may not be reused for any  coinbase transaction, issuance entry (`issuance.idSignature`), or token issuance signature (`issuance.tokens[n].idSignature`)
  - Issuing `tokenIds`'s amount of tokens must not push the circulating supply of the token over it's maximum (`issuance.supply`). If the supply is unlimited, this is ignored.
- **ELSE IF**: The transaction is a normal transaction:
  - All tokens in `tokenIds` must reside in the balance of `input.address`.



Assuming these criteria are met,  the tokens specified in `input.tokenIds` are deducted from `input.address` and credited to `output.address`. In the case of a coinbase transaction, the deduction does not occur for `input.address`. 

This filtering and balance application process is repeated for all transactions in chronological order to reach the current state of the token.





# Implementation `extends` [FATIP-0](/)

## Notes

Since issuances are ongoing, this standard requires syncing and listening to chains instead of one.
